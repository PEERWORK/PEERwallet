# peer-wallet
PEERwallet is a user-centric solution designed to onboard mainstream audiences to interact with Web3 while ensuring the security and privacy of their assets and identity.

PEERwallet serves as a hub, consolidating users' assets, credentials, and individual wallets for seamless interaction with different sites. Additionally, it features a real-time chat function to keep users informed about new proposals within their community and facilitate conversations with other members.

To streamline the onboarding process, PEERwallet offers a social sign-in option through Biconomy, making it convenient for users to create their accounts.

To provide a secure and reliable credential system, PEERwallet utilizes PolygonID and Sysmo. These systems allow users to verify their residency, age, NFT holdings, and more, without compromising privacy.

When users need to interact with various Web3 sites and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), PEERwallet employs WalletConnect to generate a new wallet and connect it to the relevant site, ensuring each interaction remains separate and secure.

Moreover, for situations where verification is necessary, such as proving eligibility for voting in a local community, PEERwallet can provide proof to the site using PolygonID or Sysmo, confirming the user's residency and voting rights.

The local community's governance is facilitated through AragonOS, enabling all residents to participate in voting on local issues.

To keep users engaged and connected, PEERwallet integrates XMTP for instant messaging and notifications, making it easy for users to stay up-to-date with new proposals and engage with their neighbors.

Overall, PEERwallet is a comprehensive and secure solution, providing a bridge for mainstream users to enter the Web3 space without compromising their assets or identity.
